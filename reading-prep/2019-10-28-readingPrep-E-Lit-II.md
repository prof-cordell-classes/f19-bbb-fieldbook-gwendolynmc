# Reading Prep: E-lit II

## Questions or Observations
1. _With Those We Love Alive_ reminded me of the text-based game/app _A Dark Room_ -- I don't know why, other than the format. I think it has to do with the general aura of futility, and the sense of having less control over the outcome than you think you have.
2. In _With Those We Love Alive_, why is the link to go back always 'look away'? What feelings does that phrase evoke that would be lost with something like 'go back'?
3. A lot of the e-lit I've seen seems to have some kind of focus on making the reader uncomfortable/on edge. Why is this such a prominent theme in the genre?
