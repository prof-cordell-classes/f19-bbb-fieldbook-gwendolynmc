## Questions or Observations

1. In cases like Pablo Medina's Bushwick typeface, what relationship does the origin of the typeface have with its implementation after it is released? Medina claims that he doesn't have a particular use in mind for his typeface, but it feels as if the user shouldn't _want_ to remove a piece of art far from its context.
2. The 'Beowulf' typeface, whose letter shapes are dictated by "randomized outlines and programmed behaviors" (p. 31) may be as close as we can get to a computer reproducing the human error or uniqueness seen in handwriting or even letterpress printing. 
3. Lupton talks about the idea of 'the user', a figure to be "scrutinized and controlled", among other things, and that "how a text is _used_ becomes more important than what it means" (p. 97). This made me think of the electronic scourge of 'fake news', where the way a text is used for fearmongering or the spread of misinformation supersedes the actual content of the text, which is often biased or outright false.
