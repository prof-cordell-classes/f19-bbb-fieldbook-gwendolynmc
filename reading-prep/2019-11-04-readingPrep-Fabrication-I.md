## Questions or Observations
1. What makes a video game console the best medium to communicate the themes in "Glitch Console"?
2. Will 3D printing a book, as discussed in the Popular Science article, ever be an efficient or large-scale method for book production?
3. Some of the projects in _Making Things and Drawing Boundaries_ are created for very specific and utilitarian purposes (e.g. Fruit are Heavy). How much do projects like this relate to books and the concepts we discuss in class?
