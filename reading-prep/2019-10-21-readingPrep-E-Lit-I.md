# Reading Prep: E-lit I

## Questions or Observations
1. In _The Reading Brain in the Digital Age_, the author concludes by questioning why screen-based reading needs to be developed with original, paper formats in mind. I thought this was interesting--I very much subscribe to the idea that a traditional book provides an irreplaceable, tactile experience, but I also greatly enjoy things like webcomics and interactive fiction, which don't fit in a paper form very well. Creating e-lit to do things that traditional books cannot seems like a much better use of the medium than just reproducing paper books digitally.
2. I wonder how much our perception of paper for "effortful learning" vs. screen reading for "fast and shallow reading of short texts" is due to social media.
3. Does the additional effort sometimes required to 'make sense' of text on a screen (i.e. following hyperlinks, being able to do Google searches) make the task more interesting and in turn make us remember the information any better?
