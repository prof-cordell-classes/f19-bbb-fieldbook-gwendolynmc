# Reading Prep: Book Alterities
### Gwendolyn McManus
## Questions or Observations

1. In _A Crash Course on Altered Books_, selecting a book to alter is solely dependent on the physical attributes and sturdiness of the object. What ways might an artist alter a book where both the sturdiness and the internal content of the book are important?
2. Are there any ethical concerns with Christian Bok's Xenotext (either current or when considering future applications)?
3. I'm really drawn to the idea of the Future Library. It reminds me of something I saw a while ago, about how there are now companies that cremate you when you die and pack your ashes around a tree seedling, so that you become a tree. The Future Library feels like a complement to that, almost.
