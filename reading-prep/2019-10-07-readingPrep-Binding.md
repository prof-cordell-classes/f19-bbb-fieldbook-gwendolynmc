## Questions or Observations
1. In _Oh, Look, A Ferry_, the authors refer to ferries as a metaphor for books, because both are "material objects that do the work of conveying." It reminds me of Borsuk's discussion on the varied definitions of a 'book', but I thought it was interesting that these authors choose to call the ferry a metaphor for books, rather than a book itself.
2. The marriage of letterpress printing and hiking feels very natural to me; both things require a lot of planning, careful thought, dedication, and time. I wonder how much the two influence each other--does the combination increase your self-awareness and reflection of both? What other things might combine in this way with letterpress?
3. Does simply printing only a few copies of something, as the case is in _Baxter's Procrustes_, make it valuable by default? What relationship is there between rarity and value?
