# Reading Prep: Zines

#### Gwendolyn McManus

## Questions or Observations

1. Does the 'retyping' style of erasure poetry (i.e. the example by Jennifer MacBain-Stepens) remove something essential from the poem's identity by taking away the original context of the page it comes from?
2. How do zines like _Pagan's Head_, where the author focuses on their own thoughts/stories without being overly concerned for the order/organization of the content, compare to social media platforms like Twitter, tumblr, or Instagram?
3. Many of digital and traditional artists now publish and sell their own zines, featuring art and sometimes behind-the-scenes pieces like sketches. Given the highly personal and identity-based nature of many zines (as discussed both in _'Zine_ and _Why the Internet Didn't Kill Zines_), should these artist zines even be called 'zines', just because they take the same small-booklet format?
