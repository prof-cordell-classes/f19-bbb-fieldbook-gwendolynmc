# Reflective: What is a Book?

## The Physical Book
I found part 1 of Borsuk's book, _The Book as Object_, slightly tedious to read. However, reflecting on my thoughts about this week, it is the section I keep coming back to. I was lucky enough to grow up surrounded by books--including an ever-expanding collection of my own--so the concept of the book as a rare item, reserved only for necessity or wealth and treated with the utmost respect, has always been somewhat difficult to wrap my head around. 

One of the things that was emphasized in both _The Book_ and in class was the fact that, for most of their existence, the most valuable part of a book has been the material. In the time where a single book took more resources and a lot of meticulous work to produce, of course we revered the object of the book.

In the 21st century, respect of books has become a very different thing: to many of us, it means dog-eared pages from multiple rereads, crumpled covers from being shoved into backpacks, and cracked spines from too much time spent face-down on a table; I bought one of my favorite books completely on impulse, because there was only one copy of it in the store and it looked like it had been in a fistfight. I think a lot of us now are drawn to roughed-up books, because we know there must be something good inside. The outside, the physical _object_ of the book itself, has suddenly become the least valuable part of the package, to the point that defacing it is a means of conveying our love.

This difference in physical value was part of what I found so fascinating about the rare books collection we saw. My mind keeps returning to that sturdy prayer book from half a millennium ago. I have a copy of the Lord of the Rings that is one tenth the age of the prayer book, and it's on the verge of falling apart despite being in good condition for its age. Having millions of copies of a modern book, as well as any number of e-book versions and publisher's digital backups, means that the more ephemeral state of today's books doesn't put us at risk of lost knowledge; still, it makes me sad to think that my own books will probably be gone long before their ancestors.
